    "The sugar beet auction was the first large scale MPC protocol that was actually used in the real world, and it implemented a double auction. The farmers wanted Danisco to not know their bidding prices, and they were able to keep them secret without the use of a trusted third party that would mediate. One possible threat is that while the bidding was binding, if they don't keep the money in escarow, there is no way to force them to pay - they still have to trust that everyone will respect the rules. They *don't*, however, need to trust Danisco or anyone else to be honest with their data as their bid pricing was never transmitted or stored in cleartext. The threat model also is suseptible to leaking the data if there are very few farmers because differential privacy is not accounted for. All servers are asumed be honest but curious."
