This means that no information can be corelated round to round and we are not able to build up intuition about a coloring as the rounds go on. The verifier gets to pick any two adjacent nodes (so picking an edge) and then we \"lift up the hats\" by revealing the color and noise we committed to. We must include the noise in this otherwise the hashes themselves reveal the colorings. Until we supply the color and noise for verification, the verifier cannot extact any info from the commitments alone. After providing the color and noise, the verifier can confirm that the two nodes they picked are, in fact, different colors, and that we had committed to those colors before we knew the random nodes they would pick."
