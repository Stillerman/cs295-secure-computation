    "Implement an electronic voting system using the Paillier cryptosystem. The system has two parts: a voter encrypts their vote using the cryptosystem and submits it to the server, and the server stores the encrypted votes and tallies them at the end of the election. The election server holds the public and private keys; the public key is available to the voters, so that they can encrypt their votes. Each voter should be able to verify that the server has correctly stored their vote, by consulting the encrypted votes to check that their vote indeed appears. Generate your public and private keys with at least 32-bit security.\n",
